# Rock the Boat
Tinker your ship. Nothing serious but QoL.

## Features
* Change max camera distance for boat
* Increase max camera distance to boat mode for anyone on board. No more staring into sail for sitters.
* Increase explore radius by multiplier (works if you are just touching the boat, no need to sit or sail)
* Prevent drowning while near the boat
* Remove ship with hammer like good old times (disabled by default)
* Reduced damage to players on boat
* Reduced damage to boat when no one are on board
* Sailing and steering force multipliers
* Configuration is server-synced
* NITRO

You can press Run button (LeftShift by default) to increase steering force while spending stamina. More time you "run" more speed you get.

## Installation (manual)
extract RockTheBoat.dll file to your BepInEx\Plugins\ folder

## Known issues
* Mod should be compatible with ValheimRaft and any other mod changing boat behavior.

## Configurating
The best way to handle configs is configuration manager. Choose one that works for you:
